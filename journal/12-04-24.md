Currently I have built a decent workflow of the following steps:

1. User uploading a song track file
2. Server-side separation of instrumental and vocal tracks
3. Vocal track to MIDI conversion, and consequently setting the tempo, key, and main track notes

Thanks to the following tools:

- [pitch.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/pitch.js) for pitch detection (I asked Windsurf to refactor it to fit with other components in the App, and I also made some further modifications like increasing step size, decresing max freq, and creating a buffer to stabilize vocal pitch detection)
- [audio-separator](https://github.com/nomadkaraoke/python-audio-separator) for instrumental/vocal track separation (primamrily using UVR models but more convenient for programmatic use)
- [basic-pitch](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch) for audio (vocal track) to MIDI conversion
- [theoria](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) for music theory calculations
